  <p>
    Project Euler(named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler) is a website that is based on math-related programming. Unlike other programming websites where, in the majority of them, you     have to submit the whole code, Project Euler only depends on the final answer. Project Euler has hundreds of many interesting math-related problems, with threads for the people who have 
    solved a certain problem to discuss their different solutions. Project Euler does not tolerate solutions being shared-but that is only for problems above 100. Problems 1-100 are        
    free to post anywhere online. Here is a repository of my solutions to Project Euler problems 1-100.
