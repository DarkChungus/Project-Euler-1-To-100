Hello. I am a 14 year old boy from Nepal. I mainly code in Python because I have been using it for the last ~4 years so I feel very comfortable with it. I got recommended by an online friend
of mine(also from Nepal) to make a github account and to upload just random codes that I make. So here in this repository, I will be uploading my project euler codes. Only problems 1-100
will be shown with the proper numbering, as to not violate Project Euler's rules. I might also upload some codes in another language such as C/C++ because I want to learn these languages
due to my laptop being very slow so I cannot run codes efficiently that would otherwise take only a few seconds. I hope you enjoy this repository.
